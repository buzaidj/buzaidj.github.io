A few years ago, after reading about [La Sombrita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sombrita), I wanted to get a good overview of LA bus stop amenities. I couldn't find any statistics or data online, so I built a tool to gather data that picks a random stop from a list and presents a street view of the stop.

### Results (as of June 2025)
Of about 175 unique stops studied, roughly **25% have shelters**, 41% have shade, and 51% have seating. Even though 41% of stops had shade during observation, the shade structures in question may be buildings or trees, offering temporary shade depending on the time of day. So, 41% could be an overestimate. If I redid the study now, Iâ€™d encourage the respondent to specify what was providing the shade.
