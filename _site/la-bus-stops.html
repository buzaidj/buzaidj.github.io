                        <p>A few years ago, after reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sombrita">La Sombrita</a>, I wanted to get a good overview of LA bus stop amenities. I couldn’t find any statistics or data online, so I built a tool to gather data that picks a random stop from a list and presents a street view of the stop.</p>

<h3 id="results-as-of-june-2025">Results (as of June 2025)</h3>
<p>I finally compiled the results a few years later. I sent the link to a few friends and have observations for around 175 unique bus stops. None of the four La Sombrita stops appear in the results (yet)! Of the 175 unique stops studied, reportedly <strong>25% have a shelter</strong>, 41% have shade, and 51% have seating. Even though 41% of stops had shade during observation, the shade structures in question seem to be buildings or trees, offering temporary shade depending on the time of day. So 41% could be an overestimate.</p>
